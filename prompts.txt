***MENU***
Lets create a menu/dialog system for my device running on Raspberry Pico. It has 8 buttons (B1...B8), 8 LEDs (L1...L8) and three separate screens (S1..S3).

There are the following types of entities exist: Top-Level menu, Submenu, Dialog

A Top-level menu is always displayed on S2 and scrolled left and right by B2 and B3. It contains the following items:

FREE
EXTERNAL
STEP
LIMITS
SETTINGS

The following item might be attached to each Top-Level menu: Dialog or Submenu.

Each Dialog has "main", "blue" and "green" mode which are controlled in the following way:
- if item is just selected by B2/B3 buttons - its mode is "main";
- if B7 (which is connected to blue LED L7) is pressed - the mode is "blue"
- if B6 (which is connected to green LED L6) is pressed - the mode is "green"

For each Submenu the B7 button works as "Back" (if applicable), the B6 works as "OK" (to go deeper, for example). Submenus might open another Submenus
or Dialogs.
